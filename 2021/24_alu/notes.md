* div z 1 --> increases up to factor (for initial_z > 0)
* diz z 26 --> has to decrase up to factor 26 -- > x must be zeroed in this case with previous z
* every block with diz z 26 has a required initial z value to reach x=0 --> all diz z 26 can be precomputed determining the target mod z value of the block before
